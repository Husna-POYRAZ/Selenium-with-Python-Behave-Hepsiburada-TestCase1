# Selenium with Python Behave

In software, a behavior is how a feature operates. A behavior is defined as a scenario of inputs, actions, and outcomes. A product or feature exhibits countless behaviors.<br><br>

BDD is a process that puts behaviors first in development and testing.
* Three Amigos Meetings bring everyone togethor
* Example Mapping helps everyone define and learn stories
* Specification by Example defines behaviors clearly
* Behavior Implementation produces features and tests

BDD is a refinement, not an overhaul, of existing processes!<br>

Behaviors are identified early in development using plain-language descriptions (Gherkin) that tell what more than how.<br>

A BDD test framework separates test cases from test code. It will "hue" each step to a Python function to run it like a script.<br>
